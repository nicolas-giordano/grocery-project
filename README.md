# grocery-project
## About
The passion for this project came about during my time as a college student. I was actively strapped for money and needed to get the most out of it when going grocery shopping. I would have to create a mental note of where I thought gave the best prices. I thought that grocery informatino should be available for people online who fall into a similar background, or wish to just cut expenses. This is an ongoing project that I wish to refine and rebuilt as I learn more about software development and offering of a service.

## Learning Outcomes
From this project, I had the following learning outcomes thus far:
- Django
- Test Driven Development
- SQL and Postgres
- Docker
- Heroku

Most of my web development up to this point had been soley in JavaScript and JavaScript libraries such as React. I wanted to gain insight on the development process in Python and decided to check out Django since it is the opposite of React (Django is similar to Angular and Flask similar to React). I followed a book on development of a Django website in a Docker environment which was a very interesting experience. I wanted some insight on technology that was actively used in the industry (Docker) so I made sure to implement that and learn how to program in a produciton-like environment. This also was one of my first projects in a long time utilizing SQL, and specifically Postgres.

## Future goals
I have put this project to the side for a little bit during my job hunt. I want to get back to actively working on this and refactoring it as well as widening the services it offers. I want to make it so that data is implemented into the backend through API endpoints. I also wish for users to be able to input their own data to grocery stores.
